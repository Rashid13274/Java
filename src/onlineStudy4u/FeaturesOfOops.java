		 Garbage collector:  which are responsible for collecting the unwated/unused object that are no longer in use.
		  An object can be overwritten.
		  An object have  not contains  value  for their parametrized constructor will return  0 to that reference.  
				  
				  
		Inheritance: it is the  mechanism  in java  by which one class is allow  to inherit  the features field and method of another class
		important termonology:  
			
			super class: the class whose features  are inherited  is known as super class or parent class.
			 sub class:  the class that inherit   the other class is known  as  sub class.
			 reusability:  inheritance  support the concept   of resuability.
			Inheritance can many level.
			
			let's see an example of  multilevel inhertance :- base class
															  intermediarory class
															  derived class
