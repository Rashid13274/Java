		/*
		 * Abstraction in java:-
		 * Data abstraction  is the property  by virtue  of which only the essential  details  are displayed to the user.
		 * the trival or non essential units  are not displayed  to the users.
		 * ex: A car is viewed  as car rather than its individual components.
		 * 
		 * Data abstraction  may also  be defined as  the process of identifying only the  required characteristics of an object 
		 *  ignoring the irrelevant details.
		 *  
		 * Data absrtruction  is achieved  by interface  and abstract  classes .we  can achieve  abstraction  using interface.
		 * 
		 * A class which can not be instantiated , whose object can not be created is called  abstract class.
		 * 
		 * it is  declared  with abstract keyword.
		 * 
		 * an abstract class  can have  parameterized  constructor  and default  constructor  is always present  in an abstract class.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * jAVA abstract  classes  are used to declare  common characteristic  of sub classes.
		 * 
		 * it can only be used  as super class for other  classes  that extends  the  abstracts  class.
		 * 
		 * like  any other  class , an abstract class can contain  fields that describes   the characteristic  and method   that  
		 * describes  the action   a class  can  performs.
		 * 
		 * you can not create  object of abstract  class  but you can create  reference  variable  of abstract  class.
		 * 
		 * 
		 * ex:1-
		 * 
		 *  abstract class A{
		 * ....
		 * }
		 * class B extends A{
		 * ....
		 * }
		 * public class AbstractExample{
		 * public static void main(string args[]){
		 * A obj= new B();  here we're giving the reference  to Class A and Storing the value In Class B.
		 * 
		 *    }
		 *       }
		 *       
		 *       
		 *  ex:2-
		 *  
		 *  abstract class person{
			 private String  name;
			 private int age;
			 public void setName(String n) {
				 name=n;
			 }
			 public void setAge(int a) {
				 age =a;
			 }
		 }
		public class Abstraction_1 {
		
			public static void main(String[] args) {
		//		person p =new Person();  output ERROR {WE CAN'T CREATE OBJECT SUCH THAT}
